MangoPlus Patch 1.2

-Updated the Aether with 3 new content mods
-Disabled jetpacks in the Aether bc the atmosphere is too thin
	Real reason for change is because of how valuable the new loot is. The aether is the only place to get shields, effectively sprint, obtain stackable food, ect. 
	This change will provide more value to moas, dungeon loot, ect. Late game items such as gravisuits will still work.
-Ambrosium stack size increased to 64, making it the only (offically) stackable food item

A world backup has been made while thermal integration is tested

MangoPlus Patch 1.4

	2MJ=20RF=5EU, FLUXGEN 5EU->15RF
	Fluxgen is less efficient than a bridge bc its cheaper

-Maces have been re-added. Gold mace damage increased, all others reduced. Some are better and some are worse than their sword counterparts.
-Damage reduction from sword block increased from 10% to 25%
-Added clay shingles
-Added framed glass
-Added more brick variants
-Added trapdoors for all wood types

-Added 2 new mobs. They're rare, and only spawn under y=20
-Haste and Resistance potions can now be brewed to replace higher tiers of efficiency and help with armor changes
-Added Matrix enchanting
-Enchantment changes:
	Some enchantments have had their max level lowered to incentivize upgrades and/or tool specialization, such as drills, silk touch ore extraction, etc..
	Efficiency 5 -> 3
	Fortune 3 -> 2
		Fortune 3 can be obtained with a drill upgrade, silk touch can also be effective in increasing ore yield
	Power 5 -> 3
		Different arrow and bow types can be used
	Knockback 2 -> 1
	Protection 4 -> 3
		Other protection enchants are unchanged. Gives a real use them.
	Infinity has been disabled due to how strong bows are in general
-Armor changes:
	Armor effectiveness is adjusted so that the more armor you have, the less every extra armor point adds to your total protection. 
	Due to how meaninglessly complicated armor toughness is, it has been removed as a direct mechanic. 
	Armor has been rebalanced.
	Protection enchantments have been similarly nerfed to ~75% max. 
	Instead of toughness acting directly on arbitrary armor damage reduction, an extra layer of calculations have been added, which greatly decreases any damage over 40 points according to your armor toughness.
	Armor degrades like how it did in beta. Low durability decreases the attributes of that specific piece of armor, so a half-broken helmet will drop your armor less than a half-broken chestplate. 
	This will incentivize the use of armor repair systems such as the aether enchanter.
	Armor stat curves are linear.
	Please note that all changes can be hot fixed at any time, and feedback (after testing in real gameplay) will be accepted.

MangoPlus Patch 1.5.1

-Added Portal Guns!
-Aqua Creepers will now only spawn during a thunderstorm
-More Enchantment changes:
	After playing with enchantments, they just felt too strong for beta still, so some more adjustments have been made.
	Sharpness 5 -> 1, Common -> Uncommon
	Protection 4 -> 2, Common -> Uncommon
	Smite 5 -> 1

	In order to obtain XP for enchanting you must craft a tome of knowledge and turn on auto pickup. You can then sneak and use it to fill your XP, however you wont be able to see it.
	Feedback is appreciated for the xp changes. It either works like this, or youll have the xp bar on your hud, and I felt that not having the xp bar was much better for the vibe of the pack.
